ABOUT KEN:
I'm an industrial psychologist interested in using data science to improve human systems. This blog serves as a repository of essays and logs I've written over the years.

These days, my main focus is leading workforce analytics efforts at SpaceX, where we synthesize principles of data science and organizational theory to inform workforce strategy.

As a strong proponent of open source, I'm also involved in community-driven projects related to decentralized science and technology. Whether it is my work on organizational health at talentDAO or working on  LLMs in public with the IRL Alpha crew in Venice, CA, I see these communities as mutual aid networks for creating digital global public goods. You can catch me on Sunday's on their live stream discussing the latest in AI.

I went into psychology to study the human condition and emerged with a realization: we are all objectively irrational nodes on the great network of humanity. To bend the levers toward progress we make appeals through memetic force but we must never cease to falsify our assumptions with science. Through this shared understanding and an alignment toward truth, we may foster cultures to challenge the status quo, encourage divergent thinking, and build solutions for our communities. For it is the human organizations we build together that serve as the mortal engines of change.
