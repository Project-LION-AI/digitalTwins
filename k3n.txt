k3nn.eth,"I can speak to this. Opscentia is trying to be THE DAO for open science. They have various ventures from funding research to fellowships to funding web3 science projects. The latest development I’ve heard from them is they are working on v-scholar which is their DeSci database and publication protocol. They also are working on CORAL which is an extension of the OCEAN protocol for data management. They have been around for some time now (couple years I believe) and they are actually backed by a non-profit which is what they leverage to gain access to grant funding. So they are truly a non-profit that operates like a DAO with a community that can vote on activities. 

OpenAccessDAO is much newer and originally had the plan of crowdsourcing funds and buying a journal to make all the work open access. That quickly became realized as not feasible mostly because journals are an organization of themselves and would require some sort of maintenance to actually keep it running. Instead the community voted on a new project which is to build their own tokenomics system for incentivizing open access work. Personally I think this is going to be a challenge for many reasons, not that it isn’t doable, but there are many many things to think through when building something like this and to make it truly open will probably require partnerships with other DAOs. My main problem with them is that they may have taken on more than they can chew with a project like this, but I’m continuing to watch from the sidelines to see how things develop. Openscientia already has a grant protocol on their website we could apply for but OpenAccessDAO is too early. There can definitely be potential partnership opportunities though — like us publishing within their system if they can successfully build it. Same goes for Opsientia with their systems. 

I am in contact with both DAOs and could reach out. Anything specific we wanted to lead with?",saulthorin,🌈general,"01/03/2022, 04:49:16"

k3nn.eth,"My immediate thoughts are that this is a great introductory piece for those who don't know much about the space and now want to know what all the fuss is about with this new term 'DAO'. If that is what you're aiming for, I think one thing useful to include would be the 'why should they care' aspect. Especially because, given the nature of our mission, we want people to be convinced that DAOs can be a viable alternative working model. So maybe talk briefly about how DAOs can make that possible? A good segway into this might be to talk about how the reason the DAO definition is so fuzzy is because they are just emerging and much of the necessary infrastructure tooling is still being build to support the vision of DAOs vitalik proposes (e.g., many DAOs vote off-chain, many DAOs start off somewhat centralized and partially gated, etc.).

By contributions, many I think really mean voting. As leveraging the community to make decisions is a key feature. While in most cases we can’t expect DAOs to be able to pay for work that currently isn’t highly valuable to them—this is one reason I think bounties work really well. It’s kinda like switching from contract jobs to contract tasks. It’s beneficial because a bounty board makes it clear what work a DAO values enough to pay for it, but at the same time it makes it clear that, actually, not everyone can contribute. However that doesn’t mean you can’t be part of the community decisions making process or buy into a DAOs token (another promising new feature), and maybe DAOs just have to be more clear about that.",lisawocken,📑all-things-dao,"01/14/2022, 15:24:53"

k3nn.eth,"It is surely an interest of mine [and of the DAO -- see <#894740849995448321>], but among some of the network experts here like <@!579128660070760469> and <@!539221068146278425> , I sometimes feel like an amateur 😆","ItamarGo, mushambo, saulthorin",👋introduction,"01/17/2022, 18:02:59"

k3nn.eth,"This question has some pretty broad implications and I think we should discuss as a community. CC: <@&909577548239884289> 

My thoughts are that open access method of scientific reporting, should be supported by a format of sharing documents that can include critical aspects of open access science e.g., data & code. In a perfect world, this to me means publications are done in notebooks [markdown, jupyter, etc.] and the rendered in html. That said, this is definitely not the standard protocol in science today so pdfs will still need to be a format option. But that also means we have to think about how someone who submits to an open access journal can submit as a pdf, but also include data and code somehow.",dsine,development-team,"01/19/2022, 02:35:27"
k3nn.eth,"Well markdown (.md) files are just one type of notebook file. There is also .ipynb and .rmd depending on the language the author codes in. We could ask them to convert it to a markdown file, but again we are starting to require authors to do things they traditionally would not do for any other journal so we’ll have to discuss the trade offs of gatekeeping via formatting requirements, or sacrificing decentralization and openness for an easier publishing experience.",,development-team,"01/19/2022, 03:29:30"
k3nn.eth,Unfortunately it’s a much more loaded question than it seems,,development-team,"01/19/2022, 03:30:12"
k3nn.eth,"Hey team, I think we should briefly discuss what is coming up right now in the <#927861348363292712> channel. And maybe this is out of scope for v1, but I think it’s important to consider what the process for publishing in an open access journal should look like. This is our opportunity to address some of the major issues with the academic publishing system such as misaligned incentives and the reproducibility crisis. We are currently discussing the file formats for submitting. While I agree we should keep traditional formats to encourage others to publish, I think we should consider [even encourage] people to submit in notebook formats. Or if we wanted to get fancy Matthew Stephenson’s idea of Planck NFT manuscripts could be worth exploring. https://www.p1anck.com/

k3nn.eth,100% . I think it’s also important not to gatekeep by imposing new rules,saulthorin,talentdao,"01/19/2022, 15:34:51"
k3nn.eth,Any of the old ways should still be acceptable,,talentdao,"01/19/2022, 15:35:20"
k3nn.eth,Figured as much! and why I mentioned it might be out of scope for v1 but wanted to get the conversation going,,talentdao,"01/19/2022, 15:38:57"
k3nn.eth,I agree. It’s a problem I have with my own alma matter that they don’t teach statistical programming enough. Unfortunately in my case the compsci program gate keeps those classes (although it’s a bit different for the PhD programs). SPSS does have a way to export the backend code tho which is SPSS syntax. This is something we could have included in the metadata or something in the same way we would include r code if they submitted a docx.,Blockpusher_J,talentdao,"01/19/2022, 15:54:48"
k3nn.eth,Fair and completely agree. I’m just happy we’re having the conversation,saulthorin,talentdao,"01/19/2022, 15:55:41"
k3nn.eth,"Yeah I think that’s the ideal solution. We build a tool that formats in markdown for you based on your submission file type. Then you get an option to adjust things in case anything didn’t come over correctly, but that’s all done in our front end. Then all papers ultimately get rendered in markdown/html",saulthorin,talentdao,"01/19/2022, 16:03:22"

k3nn.eth,"I'd like to understand this better, so I'm down to tag up for a few minutes like we did last time. What I'm gathering so far is that you are uncovering what might be a natural phenomenon where decentralization is relative to growth. And now you need to test that hypothesis on multiple communities to see if it holds. I have a mathematician friend who would love to weigh in on this if you're interested.

The bit about the Gini coefficient having the same value but different distributions reminds me of something my stats professor would tell us: “always visualize your data.” Especially with correlations where you can have a two completely different distributions but the same correlation. Keeps pointing back to how powerful network data is going to be in this space. Specifically in this context it may even help with some of the other problems you addressed like collusion. If you could map token count to node size and frequency of communication to edge length you might see something very interesting there,ItamarGo,📑all-things-dao,"01/21/2022, 04:49:59"

k3nn.eth,"talentDAO will surely be an example. But NFTs, tokens, and staking are part of the core of blockchain utility. So most if not all DAOs will leverage them in some ways. For other kinds of projects though I would encourage you to explore the DeSci ecosystem. I think it’s also important to highlight that for many DAOs a core value is to escape from trad corporate culture. Especially in todays environment where the speed at which one is required to ship something has increased rapidly over the years [related to the wage productivity gap—see www.wtfhappenedin1971.com]. People are tired of being overworked and underpaid, and DAOs will move at a slower pace for that reason in addition to reasons of decentralized leadership. That’s not to say that DAOs can’t move at a fast pace, but generally my experience is that people in DAOs are involved in many things and being full-time DAO is more uncommon than not. But we’ll see how that changes over the years.

k3nn.eth,"Hello @here For those of you that attended the community town hall, you may have heard me mention a couple of new infrastructure workflows. We now have a an official proposal submission process and a resource database that are both integrated with notion. Links to both of these can be found in <#936757058605297694> 

On **proposal submissions** - these can be literally anything from ideas and projects to full on research studies. We will review them as a community and decide on which ones to pursue.

On the **resource database** - this is a place for us to start getting all of the great resources being shared in this discord into one place that can be searched using different categories. This is still a work in progress so if you have any ideas on how to do this better please let me know. The purpose is for us to be able to leverage these resources to help idea generation for content, support literature reviews for research, and have a large selection of materials for the newsletter of decentralized work. At some point soon I plan on building out a little discord bot to scrape pinned messages [if you have experience with this and want to help DM!] in the resources and tools channels so I would ask that if there is anything that gets a lot of attention/responses/emojis from the community, we pin it so it can be found later.

If there are any questions on these things, please let me know!",,🕸infrastructure,"01/28/2022, 23:15:37"

ZackToof#5821 is also someone who can weigh in as he’s done some of the biz dev leg work already. 

Probably our biggest value prop atm is our ability to do empirically driven organizational science research and analytics. Our IO psychologists and their skills in understanding the science of organizations are really our only current product until the JDW is finished. We have other plans too (like curriculum development) but any sales right now would probably be for research or analytical services we provide to other DAOs and web3 organizations","0xMarcus, ZackToof",biz-dev,"01/29/2022, 17:38:17"

k3nn.eth,Your 100% right. That’s part of why it won’t be our only product. Just is as of right now. But to that point we are seeing a lot of interest in doing research on DAOs because it’s such a new area that people are desperate to learn about best practices on.,0xMarcus,biz-dev,"01/29/2022, 18:11:29"

k3nn.eth,saulthorin#7696 has done some of this work so he might have some scripts. A database isn’t something I think we absolutely need right now but something we should be keeping in mind for sure. We would most likely request a DAO to provide CSV files or give us the keys to their channels so we can scrape the server.,"0xMarcus, saulthorin",biz-dev,"01/29/2022, 18:23:43"
k3nn.eth,All of this can be done via python and/or r scripts. So the outline would more so have to be what kind of analysis we want to provide. Plenty of people skilled in doing the actually work here,,biz-dev,"01/29/2022, 18:24:40"
k3nn.eth,"Yes there a multiple ways to measure engagement however. ItamarGo#1996 has done some of this work on looking at it from the token front, which is publicly available by querying blockchain data. The data we would need DAOs to provide is the communication data from discord + any other sources [e.g. community forums] to look at those networks and even leveraging NLP to extract some psychometric properties of that communication.","0xMarcus, ItamarGo",biz-dev,"01/29/2022, 19:18:52"

k3nn.eth,"Thanks for sharing this. Calvin Pava has some interesting work that could be built on as well. I teach some of his stuff on sociotechnical systems which builds on some of the original tavistock work of Eric Trist when it was first discovered (at least in the literature) that organizational performance was contingent on both organization and technology. It ultimately gets at the social subsystem being a moderator for technology's effect on output. Think it could be great to link all the way back to Tavistock. Leadership style is also very relevant to this as the work group organization (which they deem most efficient) is essentially a proponent of servant leadership. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/001872675100400101
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system

Then there is this paper that talks about IT as group support systems which is also something I'd want to build on from a theoretical perspective. I find it so fascinating how they talk about technology in 1998 here, right before all this stuff started to really come to fruition. They talk about things like voting systems for decision making which sounded great on paper but never really worked out in a practical setting until now: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0021886398343006",saulthorin,🔬open-science,"01/30/2022, 16:41:50"

k3nn.eth,"Hey <#894740849995448321> and <#920122403068203068> so I've been going through the Ocean proposal template -- its quite comprehensive. As I'm plugging away please feel free to make comments on this google doc but I wanted to flag a couple things it is asking for that I feel we should discuss:

1) The grant is fairly small for a research grant. Only $3k offered for your first Ocean grant. This number goes up to 35k after you've done a few successful grants with them but they mention you can request more. Just not sure how much we will get for our first grant with them. I filled in 5k. Obviously this is still quite low compared to typical research grants. Maybe it's possible that we can obtain more than one grant from other sources for this?

2) The template asks for quite a bit of information, but two key items to discuss are a) the team working on this grant and b) the deliverables. They would like to know about both and we have not ironed any of these things out. 
2a) I know several people have said they could work on this, so we may need to formalize roles and responsibilities a bit more for this project.
2b) In terms of the deliverables, let's talk about this. My thoughts are this project would span several months, possibly quarters. Being that those working on this will be doing so part time and pro bono, I don't want to impose deadlines on anyone, but it does seem like we need to outline something.

As a final point, if you plan to be involved with this project, it would be great if you could speak up, add your thoughts and feedback, and let us know how you think you'll be able to contribute.

Once we have thoughts and feedback from everyone who wants to be involved I'll get the grant submitted and we can start planning.

As of right now there are 19 projects listed. 3 of these are still unassigned. If there are people looking to contribute, taking one of these on is a great way to start. Please feel free to respond here or DM a member of the core team (talentDAO tag) with any questions. 

For those that have assigned projects, it would be great if you could go into the project page and update the Purpose and Overview sections so people have an idea of what your project is all about. If you would like, including a current status or some notes on things you're currently doing with it would be a great addition.

Also, if there are things you know of that need to be done for your project, but they are currently living in your head, please please please(!) add them to the task board. From there you can link to your project and see the tasks back-linked from within it. **This is how we shorten the path to contribution**, so please be sure to use the tools at your disposal!

1) not having the money in the treasury to cover the overhead. I personally don't have the means right now to be putting up much capital outside of genesis club.
2) taking on a personal tax liability that I'm currently not comfortable with. My understanding is that everyone on the LLC will be taxed based on their share of the profits.

k3nn.eth,"Hey <@&909577548239884289> team -- so after a meeting with my research team on the NLP/psychometrics/ONA project I've been working on, we were thinking it might be best to make this an official talentDAO project. To do this, I wouldn't need anything from you guys other than sign off that we are ok with it. For a brief idea of what the project is, you can checkout the readme on the github repo: https://github.com/kencav/project-lion/blob/master/README.md

But essentially we are going to be using discord data to train transformer based NLP models to output an aggregate voice of a community and run various classification and clustering tasks on the data to produce a network model with NLP aspects incorporated. 

The team is literally top notch talent including:
- a good friend of mine Stanley who is a mathematician, AI scientist, and head of Data science at a biotech startup. He's also contributed to many DAOs.
- Mickey who is a harvard alumn and currently the AI lead at Pulsr, an NFT image search org. She was formally working on autopilot at Tesla. 
- Patman, who <@!579128660070760469> introduced me to (TY TY!) who is a mathematician who specializes in NLP, but is very well versed in developing ML products. 
- And Jessie who is our resident software/data engineer helping us build this thing. She's held positions at Apple, CBS, and now NBC on the corporate applications side and she's help build the infrastructure for the BrightMoments DAO.

The project is still early on but with a team like this I'm super confident we will deliver. I also think they would be great assets to talentDAO in general.",saulthorin,talentdao,"02/16/2022, 18:53:34"
k3nn.eth,"As of right now we've been running into a blocker in terms of data. Consider this a follow up on DAOdash access <@!579128660070760469> 😅 . Mickey is also working on getting us access to Pulsr's discord, but would like to see some sort of webpage with info about the project that she can show her founder to get her onboard (this is where setting this up under talentDAO is helpful). In the meantime, we will be doing some testing with twitter and reddit data. 

Ultimately, my goal for this product is open source. But I would like to explore some token gated premium features on top of the OS software when it is developed. I would particularly be interested in compensating maintainers.

Also, we plan to write a paper on this. Ideally, we will submit for publishing in the JDW.",saulthorin,talentdao,"02/16/2022, 18:55:17"
k3nn.eth,"If enough of the team is good with this, I will build out a new section of the notion for the project people like Mickey can refer to get some information about what we are trying to do before they agree to share their data.

k3nn.eth,"I don't think hierarchy is necessarily bad in and of itself and I don't think that its bad for DAOs to use some form of hierarchy if they wish but I also don't think its absolutely necessary. I think it was <@!579128660070760469>  who recently shared something on how DAOs can spin up multiple child DAOs as a way to keep teams small and focused on specific areas. Each of these sub DAOs can vote on things independently that are pertinent to them while the whole ecosystem can vote on things that matter to the entirety of the community. In a way this is hierarchical because you do have a DAO at the top but it's not hierarchical in a way where one person has the final say. It's sort of like imposing a system of checks and balances. 

I think it's a natural human tendency to see complexity and want to organize it. As DAOs scale [just like any organization] there becomes an apparent need for structure and formalized leadership. Some DAOs will be ok with this approach and some will have a big problem with it. This is the kicker really. DAOs are built bottom up, rather than top down like trad organizations. It is the community, rather than a founder who sets the the rules of engagement. If the community accepts hierarchy, then there is nothing wrong with it. All that matters in a DAO is that the rules of engagement are set democratically. And if they are not and people don't like it, well... they'll just leave. 

So in this way, DAOs are incentivized to do what the community wants. What is interesting is that in the parentDAO-subDAO organization I mentioned earlier, there is somewhat of a need for formalized leadership, even tho the model is more decentralized. At least one person, if not a group of people, needs to understand the goals and history of the organization well enough to be able to function efficiently within their subDAO. So in a way, even more decentralized models require a bit of hierarchy, but it's the community who decides these things at the end of the day.","0xMarcus, saulthorin",🚀future-of-work,"02/25/2022, 15:42:26"

k3nn.eth,awesome. thank you <@!713430239690096671> . At this point the proposal is pretty much set. If there are any additional comments in the doc tonight that i havnt addressed I will address them then but otherwise I will be submitting this tonight before the deadline tomorrow,Nemo-phd,❤network-health,"02/28/2022, 19:37:08"
k3nn.eth,"is everyone (specifically, <@!713430239690096671> sherifoz#7023 ) ok with the 35 day timeline on delivering this? My capacity to work on it should remain consistent through June. At that point I will be traveling for 10 days and then will need to shift to mostly prepping for the summer course i’m teaching. 

In the proposal we commit to 35 days for lit review / write-up and a pre-validated survey design. However, proposals take almost the entire month of march before funding is announced, so really we have like 60 days from submission. I think if we get started on literature review this month we should be able to start workin on survey design and the write up for April.

the next thing i’m going to do for this is write up the project page and tasks for conducting lit review so the community can get involved. will also have a place to store papers in notion.","sherifoz, Nemo-phd",❤network-health,"02/28/2022, 19:45:38"

k3nn.eth,"Great points <@!543858285808320512> . I think our best bet [and how I've been thinking about it] is as <@!713430239690096671> put it, to use previously validated scales and adapt them to DAOs and revalidate. As far as the roadmap goes, we are not constrained by it for this proposal since this is only for the lit review and the pre-validated survey. Everything after phase 1 can be changed as the project moves on. We'll just want to have the next phase ironed out if we are submitting another proposal.

And btw, in my eyes the pre-validated survey is our best attempt at creating an empirically driven DAO health survey without any validation steps. This is not a giant 150 item survey. This will be your typical org survey tailored for measuring DAO contributor health. Not scientific, but empirically driven.","sherifoz, Nemo-phd",❤network-health,"03/01/2022, 03:46:45"
k3nn.eth,"tbh I think we can put together a pretty strong survey between all of us w/ our experience. Hopefully the final validated version won't be far off of what we come up with, but the data collection and validation piece can certainly be extended if we feel its necessary to. I think if we were to deliver the survey that is necessary to do the validation as the pre-validated survey, no one will appreciate it because it will be too long.",,❤network-health,"03/01/2022, 03:52:40"
k3nn.eth,"Ok so the proposal has been submitted. Proposals are submitted via their dApp and there actually only was a section for description of the proposal and the core team.

any other preferences days/times? Would like to be sure our the core contributors for this would be able to meet [generally].

They only used perceived decentralization bc obviously it was too difficult to measure decentralization and they didn't find a relationship. I wonder if that would be different in the context of a DAO since today we can actually measure decentralization. 

Also makes me think that we should include some sort of measure on governance and/or decision making satisfaction. Does anyone know where to start with that?

k3nn.eth,"at the end of the day my biggest concern is tax liability. What I want to avoid is being taxed on a sum of income i did not receive. This model sounds straightforward enough, but I’d like to better understand how receivables will be classified. I’m guessing in this model, the DAO is taxed annually (so we’ll just have to do some accounting to ensure we are setting $ aside for that) and then each of us will have to report income received individually? Will other receivables sent to the DAO be tax liabilities for those on the LLC? 

Doing my taxes this year was a nightmare lol (thank you NFTs) so I just want to be as prepared as I possibly can. The way it seemed with taxes this year is that everything received to a wallet is taxable, so launching our token will be taxable as well. I’m guessing we would have to either sell off some of our share to cover the liability or cover it on our own with cash.",saulthorin,talentdao,"03/15/2022, 21:16:36"

The survey is a 'contributor health' survey and <@!543858285808320512>  made a good point that well-being related measures should be included. I love the MHI-5 for this. In terms of burnout, it could be worth measuring job demand and stress as well as fatigue related symptoms typically associated with burnout because at the end of the day this is what the end user will find valuable. For the fully validated survey, we should explore this more deeply, but for our definitions I think we are looking for the fatigue like symptoms that result in job withdrawal","sherifoz, Mr.Nobody",❤network-health,"03/23/2022, 17:11:10"

k3nn.eth,just try not to make to many changes to things or just add notes/comments. I already did a voting round so changes can get confusing,Nemo-phd,❤network-health,"03/27/2022, 21:10:58"
k3nn.eth,"also this is the message I'm sending to other DAO leaders to get a pulse from them:

""Hey [name] - Would love your thoughts on something... 

We are designing a DAO contributor health survey at talentDAO and we're looking for thoughts from community leaders on the aspects of the human element of DAOs they would be interested in measuring. 

Some examples of things we are already measuring are engagement, burnout, well-being, and satisfaction with the experience in the DAO. 

Since you're a DAO leader, I'd love to hear what would be interesting/important for you to measure in a survey like this.""",,❤network-health,"03/27/2022, 21:11:45"
k3nn.eth,some thoughts on satisfaction with the governance process. We should consider coming up with some general satisfaction questions around governance. I’d use something that exists already but I couldn’t find anything myself,,❤network-health,"03/27/2022, 21:39:29"

k3nn.eth,Love this. DAOs are in need for good publicity like this while the rest of web3 gets called a con. Glad to see them getting the attention they deserve.

k3nn.eth,"I’m just reading through this but scraping the info should be relatively easy with DAO dash if they use the same INTRO template each time. Forms can work too but surprisingly a bit more difficult to automate because that requires an API from the form provider. I could definitely scope this out and outline what needs to be done from a technical standpoint, then maybe we can put out a bounty for it",sherifoz,📜culture,"03/28/2022, 19:02:42"
k3nn.eth,I’ll be on the call to discuss further but some things to consider — where will these cards live? In a database? Website?

Then a discord bot can pick up every time one is minted and we can have a channel of these for new joiners.,,📜culture,"03/28/2022, 19:06:12"
k3nn.eth,maybe these cards can go beyond the onboarding use case and represent a web3 DAO contributor/member database akin to a traditional employee database,,📜culture,"03/28/2022, 19:08:04"

- DAO Network Health Survey
 or 
- Contributor Network Health Survey",,❤network-health,"03/29/2022, 14:44:09"
k3nn.eth,"Does it make more sense given the broader scope of our research here? Is it more intuitive what we would be measuring with it?

k3nn.eth,or is it easier for everyone to just copy again and filter out anything with a total = 0,,❤network-health,"03/31/2022, 00:23:21"
k3nn.eth,actually we may have to do the second sheet so each vote is only 1,,❤network-health,"03/31/2022, 00:23:55"
k3nn.eth,like if we voted on the same copy some votes would have 2s in our column. We need to reset the votes each round after eliminating the 0s,,❤network-health,"03/31/2022, 00:53:31"

does anyone have suggestions on how to host a discord bot or web application in a decentralized way? something that isn’t a protocol in itself but could interface with a protocol, e.g., mint an NFT badge for completion of a task?

what scale did they use (lol)

what app is this?? i love the summary report layout… soo smooth",Nemo-phd,❤network-health,"03/31/2022, 01:39:20"

k3nn.eth,they have their own 2 item scale IP it sounds like,,❤network-health,"03/31/2022, 01:40:49"
k3nn.eth,"ok I did this. I also reset the vote counts. With 96 left and 2 more rounds while wanting to get to under/over 40, maybe let's aim for half, so 48? or about 50? We aimed for 70 before and dropped 20 questions so 50 should force our hand a bit more. Thoughts?",sherifoz,❤network-health,"03/31/2022, 02:55:31"
k3nn.eth,you all should be able to copy again and fill in your round 2 votes and then just paste back in like last time,,❤network-health,"03/31/2022, 02:56:12"
k3nn.eth,btw i notice we only have 2 constructs for team/guild: psych safety and shared leadership. There is some overlap with TMS tho which is currently assigned at the DAO level. Any thoughts on anything else we might want to include at the team level?,,❤network-health,"03/31/2022, 03:07:12"
k3nn.eth,shared leadership also has some overlap. Maybe we want to have Qs for them at both levels?,,❤network-health,"03/31/2022, 03:08:11"
k3nn.eth,I also added some arbitrary construct names to the NIOSH WellB Questionnaire to make it easier to review from the construct level,,❤network-health,"03/31/2022, 03:18:32"
k3nn.eth,So after you do your second round vote I would recommend doing a pivot table on what you voted to see the distribution of constructs and levels to votes. That helped me make some decisions on which votes to drop after I over voted a little bit,,❤network-health,"03/31/2022, 03:36:41"
k3nn.eth,So I got myself to 60 and I gotta say this is much harder than I thought the second time around. All of these questions feel valuable. I'm considering making it ~50-60 questions now. Thoughts?,,❤network-health,"03/31/2022, 03:45:26"
k3nn.eth,"agree with what your sayin here Mr.Nobody#0187 and we should include cohesion and team empowerment, i think they just got missed when we put everything together. My thoughts were that once we finish voting we’ll have to go back in anyway to review the survey objectively and see what we’re missing.

k3nn.eth,they don’t have much on the follower counts and i’m not really sure what a good engagement rate is so idk if that’s useful but it looks like we’ve gained 145 followers in the last month which is 145/240 or 60% growth,,talentdao,"03/31/2022, 15:52:56"

k3nn.eth,"Hey team — It's starting to feel like the home stretch of this project! I'm aiming to have this done by April 14th before I go away for a long weekend and I'm happy to take on the bulk of the work to get us over the finish line, but I could use some help on a few things [in addition to finalizing our survey]:

After doing a theoretical mapping I believe we are actually looking at this in all the right ways which gave me more confidence in our approach. I've added it into the write-up [pending final review from our discussion this Wednesday].

I've also added descriptions for each construct from the individual level at this point, need to add the team and organizational levels next.

**First question:** what are your thoughts on the way we go about explaining constructs. Is it too little? Too much? Should we just put it in a table and keep descriptions short? Would love to hear thoughts.

In addition to this, I've completed the remaining sections of the write-up with the exception of lit review and expert panel bc we have to see how the process all plays out before I write up the details [most of it is already there though].

**Second question:** In addition to finalizing the survey design, I could really use your input/feedback on the write-up. When you have some time, could you please jump into it and start adding your comments? [P.S., please comment rather than edit as the document will get messy]

One other thing I need to do for this is add in all the citations. I've been filling in [CITE] where they belong, but there are surely some other places where they are needed. If you are looking for something low-lift to do on this project, filling in citations and references would be a big help. 

**Third question:** What is a good tool for creating figures? I created those currently in the doc in Google Slides. I'm sure there is a better way for the final write-up.

Ok so we are ready for round 3 of expert review panel voting. 

I'm proposing we approach this round a little differently. Rather than casting a specific number of votes, I think we need to be voting more at the construct level. 

At this point, each construct remaining in the doc is one we've deemed important and considered in our theoretical mapping. What I think we need to do next is determine which of the questions under each construct is sufficient to measure the construct in the DAO context. So for each construct, review the questions and vote on the one's you think can sufficiently measure it.

Let's aim to have this done for our Friday session. Then we can discuss the final question set and based on the length of the survey we can either:
a) locate single item measures that may replace multi-item sets
or b) write new questions in our best attempt to consolidate the items into a single or 2-item measure.

Obviously, a) is more desirable for validity's sake, but if none exist, creating our own might not be as bad as you think. I've done this quite often in the practical setting and after doing factor analyses and regressions, custom measures I've came up have tended to be reasonably correlated with the real thing, as well as the outcomes we've intended to predict.

Lastly, I also propose we move up our Friday lab to 8:30 EST. I believe everyone working on this project is interested in attending the DAO Dash call, but I also think we will need the full our of discussion.

Please let me know if you disagree or have a different take on any of this. Otherwise, I'm looking forward to our discussion tomorrow!","sherifoz, Mr.Nobody, Nemo-phd",❤network-health,"04/07/2022, 15:13:27"

A table of contents would allow them to skip to the interesting parts. There are also ways to make it a link so you can click each item and it bring you down to the section of the essay

They know the space well and have helped some artists be really successful so I think they would offer great guidance to us.

Are you more referring to governance or org structure here?

Either way, I think with flat orgs, the only way power dynamics can be assessed [without having formal titles to indicate hierarchy] is through behavioral indicators, which can be extracted from surveys, communication data, or on-chain activity mapped to a network graph.

k3nn.eth,Ok so what you need is for me to go in and add wallets for ItamarGo#1996 sherifoz#7023 Mr.Nobody#0187 and a new one for you first it sounds like? Can everyone send me their wallet address they want added? Sherif and Pietro you’ve sent me urs before so lmk if i should just use those,"sherifoz, ItamarGo, Mr.Nobody, saulthorin",talentdao,"05/06/2022, 14:53:15"
k3nn.eth,I’m not sure tbh,sherifoz,talentdao,"05/06/2022, 15:02:42"
k3nn.eth,who owns these wallets? We should name them:,,talentdao,"05/06/2022, 15:18:13"
k3nn.eth,also not seeing how to add more. Is 5 the max?,,talentdao,"05/06/2022, 15:19:31"
k3nn.eth,doesn't seem to be any option for that,,talentdao,"05/06/2022, 15:24:03"
k3nn.eth,yeah i don’t seem to have that option,,talentdao,"05/06/2022, 15:55:44"
k3nn.eth,also doesn’t look like that maybe old docs?,,talentdao,"05/06/2022, 15:55:55"
k3nn.eth,well now i’m not actually sure what’s the difference between gnosis safe and parcel.money,,talentdao,"05/06/2022, 15:56:20"
k3nn.eth,network health call,,❤network-health,"05/06/2022, 16:06:51"
k3nn.eth,"Totally agree! We've spent less time focusing on the network health side of this and more on the psychometrics for now, but we totally plan on pivoting and would love to have you help out with that!",Ene SS Rawa,❤network-health,"05/06/2022, 16:51:38"
k3nn.eth,Absolutely!,Ene SS Rawa,❤network-health,"05/06/2022, 17:07:09"
k3nn.eth,just sent you a fr. shoot me a DM once you get it,,❤network-health,"05/06/2022, 17:07:41"
k3nn.eth,ok still not sure how to add more people tho :/,,talentdao,"05/06/2022, 18:06:16"
k3nn.eth,"saulthorin#7696 if you know which of those wallet is yours, I can replace it",saulthorin,talentdao,"05/06/2022, 18:06:28"
k3nn.eth,"Also, <@&909577548239884289>  I completely forgot to bring this up on the network health call, but what is the appetite for getting a talenDAO blocksurvey subscription? I think deploying talentDAO surveys on their platform when we do things like validation as well as other survey consulting or what not would be great bc we can say ""hey, our platform is secured with end to end encryption and your data is safe with us."" Unlike google forms, which is also a lot less pretty and less customizable. I believe the team plan was $20/user/mo starting at a minimum 2 users, so $40.",,talentdao,"05/06/2022, 18:09:21"

k3nn.eth,That’s awesome my alma mater is cuse!,andysevens,👋introduction,"05/08/2022, 04:05:22"
k3nn.eth,"there are 10 of us and this has 5 votes, but saulthorin#7696 u didn’t vote and said you support. I’m going to take that as a vote passed then. So we can pay in crypto too which is great. Do we want to pay in ETH? BTC? DAI? They will provide the wallet address. I say we pay for 1-3 months first to make sure we actually love it then go for the full year. Thoughts?",saulthorin,talentdao,"05/08/2022, 17:07:35"
k3nn.eth,"Also, saulthorin#7696 if u want to tb on the treasury stuff u needed done, i’m available today",saulthorin,talentdao,"05/08/2022, 17:08:05"
k3nn.eth,"this sounds awesome. Let me know how i can help. I think it would be good to submit a proposal about the project as well. Go to <#936757058605297694> and you’ll see one for submissions. Sounds like you’d have a lot of support, but would be awesome if there was a way to open up the opportunity to the broader community through a vote.

k3nn.eth,I have not figured out how to add anyone,,talentdao,"05/08/2022, 18:09:58"
k3nn.eth,i can only seem to change wallets,,talentdao,"05/08/2022, 18:10:09"
k3nn.eth,is it possible only your wallet has that ability?,,talentdao,"05/08/2022, 18:10:35"
k3nn.eth,i can update existing users so we can update ur old wallet if u can identify it,,talentdao,"05/08/2022, 18:11:03"
k3nn.eth,"yeah i don't have access to the treasury in gnosis safe, only parcel.money",saulthorin,talentdao,"05/08/2022, 19:50:42"
k3nn.eth,"I can add an existing safe, and would need the safe name and safe address to load it",,talentdao,"05/08/2022, 19:51:28"
k3nn.eth,ok i’m in,,talentdao,"05/08/2022, 21:36:13"
k3nn.eth,ok so I just tried to add ItamarGo#1996 and adding people is actually a transaction that has to be approved as well lol,ItamarGo,talentdao,"05/08/2022, 21:40:40"
k3nn.eth,"I added everyone, but I guess we will need Nemo-phd#3075  and lisawocken#2091 to go in and approve","lisawocken, Nemo-phd",talentdao,"05/08/2022, 21:43:28"
k3nn.eth,these transactions also appear in parcel.money so you both can go in and approve from there instead of importing the gnosis safe,,talentdao,"05/08/2022, 21:44:12"
k3nn.eth,"saulthorin#7696 just so im clear, could you send me both the old and new wallet address for you so i can replace it? That might not need to be a transaction",saulthorin,talentdao,"05/08/2022, 21:45:06"
k3nn.eth,"nvm i thought it could but i couldnt, going to have to add you like the otherrs",,talentdao,"05/08/2022, 21:59:32"

k3nn.eth,yes plz!,,talentdao,"05/11/2022, 19:01:52"
k3nn.eth,but yeah nemo needs to approve the others and then execute,,talentdao,"05/11/2022, 19:02:02"

k3nn.eth,so i executed and got an error,,talentdao,"05/11/2022, 19:06:20"
k3nn.eth,but it also says for me its on the transaction executed step,,talentdao,"05/11/2022, 19:06:30"

k3nn.eth,"Good questions.

regarding 1) yes i think we should do this, and can be as simple as asking a few more questions in the survey or just extracting information about their dao on our own based on what is publicly available.

regarding 2) this is a great idea, we can allow them to “opt-in” to future survey research or even link to others going on.

also makes me think of how we can reward these. First thought is POAPs.",Erin,❤network-health,"05/13/2022, 22:04:47"

I can think of a few issues already with conflicts of interest as well the long term outlook on staking yields being sufficient to cover the cost of the workforce.

k3nn.eth,"what resonated with me is that 1) almost none of the existing tokenomics models have been proven to work, we only know of the “good-so-far”s and 2) at the end of the day it’s a marketing trick to attract investors, and the entire point of it from the inside is that we drive up the token price and earn ourselves some liquidity to achieve our goals",,talentdao,"05/24/2022, 00:33:16"

k3nn.eth,"hey team, just wanted to give everyone a heads up that my weekly availability may soon be dropping significantly. You may have seen the news recently that Elon is calling everyone back to the office. I’ve been continuing to work remote since then but I just got notice things are about to tighten up and I’ll have to be in full-time (at least for the short term). Huge bummer since I’ve never had an issue getting things done and had the benefit of being able to coordinate with ya’ll on our work during regular biz ours. In the office our network blocks a lot, so it’s tough to get anything else done (also just not ideal optics lol). I’m not 100% sure yet what this means for things I’m involved in, but at the least it probably means I won’t be able to actively participate (can still listen in) in meetings / town halls in the way i used too.

sherifoz#7023 Mr.Nobody#0187 Nemo-phd#3075 if we can keep dao health calls early (preferably 8 AM PST) I should still be able to attend those and participate. Anything later than that, my participation starts to become limited.

Aside from that, it mostly just means the amount of time I can spend on things weekly will be less, though I still plan on working on things on nights and weekends, i imagine productivity on talentDAO things overall will take a bit of a hit.

I honestly don’t think this will be permanent for corporate employees, but it’s hard to say. For the time being I’ll be trying to figure out a new workflow that works for me, so hopefully should be back in the groove of things soon","sherifoz, Mr.Nobody, Nemo-phd",talentdao,"06/06/2022, 19:28:24"

That said, I’m all for the network analysis side of DAO Health, but there are some issues with doing that now. Namely, lack of a validated DAO Health survey and data on other DAOs.

That said, when it comes to looking at on-chain data, there is surely some opportunity there. However, (correct me if i’m wrong saulthorin#7696 ) this is limited to token holdings, token txns, and governance activity (i.e. voting). These three things alone don’t give us the data we need to do ONA or PNA, but that’s not to say we don’t have the ability to do something else with it, I’m just not sure there is much that can be done w that data in the domain of org science.

One potential area for network analysis would be with communication data, and there is plenty available in discord, but that would require us get permission from other DAOs to use their data, which, from my experience with project lion so far, is nontrivial.","Mr.Nobody, saulthorin",talentdao,"06/07/2022, 21:11:27"

k3nn.eth,"i have a project idea that i was thinking of submitting a proposal on once i get all my thoughts together that i think would be high impact and straightforward enough for someone else to lead. Basically, i’d like us to start researching the different kinds of org structures/designs that DAOs are adopting, the level of decentralization (both in terms of tokenomics/governance and authority) and put together a taxonomy of all those different types. From there, we can begin to research the trade-offs of each one to ultimately produce a guidebook for DAO org design",,🎯general,"06/08/2022, 19:25:14"

there have been quite a few new people in the discord recently who have expressed desires to contribute. You are all welcome to submit a proposal with an idea for your project via the link Mr.Nobody#0187 shared above. 

However, I wanted to flag a few potential proposals that new contributors can potentially take on:

1) The DAO Structure & Design NFT Book — I mentioned this in general the other day, I think this could be a great project for us to raise funds and provide valuable insights to the DAO ecosystem: https://talentdao.notion.site/DAO-Structure-Design-NFT-Book-d078dea9b00943d0ac8976ff50f70ccb

2) talentDAO podcast — really all we need is a host: https://talentdao.notion.site/talentDAO-Podcast-34e9b8708afb4684ab94bc30c60ff36b

3) DAO Network Analysis Course — would be great for someone with these skills do build something: https://talentdao.notion.site/DAO-Network-Analysis-Course-965c2fe064e14e61b7ade7f8716d3808

All of these are just proposals that still need to be voted on by the community. But if there is interest in taking lead on these, I'm sure you will have community support. 

There are a few other projects listed on our proposals page as well: https://talentdao.notion.site/d002eb3c81f34748aeca0f454af6bf59?v=71b45c495087436ea768bccf269c9982

k3nn.eth,"since my bandwidth is limited we need someone to lead this project, but that doesnt require you to have all of those outlined skills (would certainly help tho). The project lead can simply take a PM role if they are not an SME in the areas I outlined. I would say this project needs at least one researcher (ideally 2-3) with experience doing qualitative research, ideally within the org sciences but not necessarily. It also needs someone familiar with executing an NFT project. If the lead on this project does not have those skills, I would say task number 1 is finding interested people that do. Once we find those people, I’d be happy to host a call where we discuss the vision for this in more detail. I can be involved in an advisory role throughout the project so will join as many calls as I can, but after the initial call these should be led by the project lead. After that initial call on the vision with interested contributors, we can update the proposal to reflect the discussion and put it up to a community vote.

k3nn.eth,"Hey team,

Wanted to share the update that unfortunately, we did not get the funding we asked for from Ocean. We were granted a total of 41 OCEAN, but with the coin trading at ~.20c right now, that is obviously not even close to what we were asking for.

**We still plan to continue working on this project**, as it's a key part of the roadmap to building out the network health initiative, but we won't be able to compensate for any work at this time.

That said, we have a couple options we will be exploring for future funding. First, I am going to discuss with OCEAN the consequences of accepting or declining the 41 OCEAN. Since we plan on completing the project anyway, if there is a chance we can be put into good standing and it opens up a greater funding round for us (this round was 10k max, the next round is supposed to be 30k max), we may take it. There is a requirement to ship something in 3 months though to have that standing, and given that this may be a short timespan to get something of this nature done, especially without compensation, we don't want to put that pressure on anyone. I'm hoping that conversation ends with us being able to submit some progress updates or something of the sort to keep good standing. Otherwise, it will probably be best for us to turn down the 41 OCEAN and reapply in the future when we have a more tangible deliverable we can ship.

We're also going to explore other grant opportunities for this project and I'll be double checking with Ocean that this is ok. If we do manage to get funding from e.g., SCRF or elsewhere we'll have another discussion about how that should look in terms of the work and compensation.

As far as **next steps for the project** itself, we've got a lot of feedback and revisions for the construct definitions. Next step is to add them back into notion and finalize the set. After that we can build the survey. Let me know if you'd like to help with this. I'll be chipping at it on sunday.",,❤network-health,"06/25/2022, 01:23:11"

k3nn.eth,"Just wanted to circle back here and close the loop cc: saulthorin#7696 

I just spoke with Ocean and the grant amount was not a mistake. We were competing against 3 other 2nd/3rd earmark projects and ours got the least votes of the 4. The reason we got anything at all was due to quadratic funding which distributes funds based on votes.

k3nn.eth,"so we had a few of these questions and ultimately decided against them. They were part of the organizational commitment scale that we landed on. The org commitment questions we have are: 

1) I am committed to the long term success of this DAO
2) Contributors are willing to put in a great deal more effort than is normally expected to help this DAO succeed

This questions also doesn’t seem to include a belonging measure, at least any of the items we defined:
1) I feel a sense of belonging at this DAO
2) I identify myself as a member of this DAO

I wouldn’t be opposed to adding one or two of these questions you listed but having a hard time with replacing belonging with these. Considering some evidence we have for belonging to be interrelated with other constructs as well as IMO it being a good construct from a marketing perspective as it’s more familiar to lay people.

The other thing it seems is that based on the screenshot you’ve posted, OID and org commitment are closely associated in practice. This instrument is supposed to be practical—something that helps predict positive DAO outcomes. In that regard, i’m not sure how much value there is to add these items if we can expect belonging and OC to hold that same predictive validity",sherifoz,❤network-health,"07/29/2022, 15:12:40"

k3nn.eth,amazing episode from the DeSci podcast with Balaji — https://youtu.be/xrcRI_hYDtQ,,🔬open-science,"08/08/2022, 17:31:48"
k3nn.eth,"listening to balaji speak in the latest DeSci podcast ep has me thinking about what our future state could like like. In our last community call, we talked about how we are much bigger than just a DeSci DAO, and I wholeheartedly agree. But at least me interpretation of that is not that we are not doing decentralized science [we certainly are] but that we have so much more to offer and that bucket might be limiting. I have yet to read the networked state, but i’ve read vitaliks review and am currently reading the sovereign individual so i think i have some decent priors about what that looks like for us. And while the idea of true sovereignty and ownership over a talentDAO state may be a long shot at this stage of the game, I think it’s a good though experiment into what this DAO should look like in the future. Back tracking to our organizational science foundations, I wonder how this DAO can make the field of organizational science as a whole, better. This thinking routes me back through some of the current problems with science and academia, and how the centralized institutions currently holding them up are failing. So if there was a next gen institution that lifts up organizational science and betters the world through improving the way humans coordinate on a global scale, I think it’s very reasonable for that institution to be talentDAO. In that regard, when you think of such institutions, what else do they offer? I think we’ve checked the box on community and research, and we’re on a clear path to building useful scientific products that such an institution would need, but one aspect that i think might be missing (and arguably the hardest one to pull off) is the education aspect. We’ve talked about this ama bit before, but when you think of an academic institution today, part of their network affect comes from who they employ as educators (professors) who not only do research but teach students who spread their teachings and in return, grow the network.",,talentdao,"08/08/2022, 17:45:34"
k3nn.eth,"these are just some thoughts i wanted to share with the core team, nothing to act on, but just consider, if we become the organizational science institute of the future, what are things do you imagine that institute having that we don’t currently offer now?

For me that is the education aspect and given the amount of expertise we have here, I don’t see any reason why we couldn’t create some paid courses that could generate revenue and help grow the talentDAO network",,talentdao,"08/08/2022, 17:47:31"

I also have not been so great at keeping on top of things myself — work has been very busy and have had to work a little more on project LION recently. Once i’m back it would be great to reconvene. I don’t think we are very far off launching a survey, but there seems to be a few important points that would warrant a group discussion. 

Also, given this teams bandwidth, I would highly encourage us to consider onboarding some support from students. Hopefully gitcoin makes this much more possible, but offering a small stipend to a student to execute admin tasks that need doing (e.g., updating blocksurvey, researching, writing, etc.) would make this project move along 100x faster. LabDAO has been doing this with great success onboarding some really smart undergrads as interns/apprenticeships who take care of the administrative tasks that others don’t have the time to do. I know we are all connected enough in academia to find someone. A few hundred dollars can probably take this phase of the project over the finish line.

Probably would be a simple landing page with the statistics that can get updated each time we run a survey. The intention would be to have this as a funded project. Thought it sounded great and wanted to share here to get initial thoughts. Mec is putting together a short explainer that we can share with the broader DAO to generate interest in the next couple days.,,talentdao,"10/03/2022, 16:10:10"

k3nn.eth,small following on twitter but i believe they raised as much as us during the round and Mec said ~1200 people in the community,,talentdao,"10/03/2022, 21:10:18"
k3nn.eth,Partially funded by Mec but she is also working on getting additional funding partners on board,,talentdao,"10/03/2022, 21:10:49"
k3nn.eth,probably not a huge sum of money but the project itself is fairly low lift and it would likely just be the first of a much larger snowball,,talentdao,"10/03/2022, 21:11:33"

k3nn.eth,IMO this is an easy win for us to get involved with an influential founder on a true public good project,,talentdao,"10/03/2022, 21:13:15"
k3nn.eth,survey would be fairly simple like sub 10 questions maybe sub 5 and Mec would help get people to participate. From there aggregating the data should be easy enough and there are plenty of hosting options which I assume Mec will decide on and cover.,,talentdao,"10/03/2022, 21:17:10"

k3nn.eth,"this makes sense to me. I’m not sure how “randomized” we’ll be able to get tho. There would always be some level of bias given the nature of the population and how we’ll make them aware of the survey (i.e., outreach on social media and to other DAOs). Tho i’m not sure that would be a problem. If we are concerned with that we can probably come up with a list of DAOs to reach out to and either randomize which DAOs we reach out to or reach out to all of the and randomly sample from those that do participate",sherifoz,❤network-health,"10/07/2022, 14:08:22"

k3nn.eth,Nemo-phd#3075 to be clear are you saying that you'd prefer hand selecting people over the true naive raters approach,Nemo-phd,❤network-health,"10/08/2022, 15:08:57"
k3nn.eth,"maybe i need to do some more reading, but this is the way i'm leaning. here are my reasons:
- naive raters makes sense but almost all of our questions are context dependent on DAOs
- many of these have been PRE-VALIDATED in an adjacent organizational context so there is already some evidence these questions are valid
- we want to validate them in THIS context
- even for some of the new questions tho, this kinda of validation requires context and it is far too easy to share a public link and get the wrong type of person just going after the reward
- qualifiers can be gamed
- using our network to find respondents would ensure the quality of respondents at the risk of biasing the sample",,❤network-health,"10/08/2022, 15:25:01"

Would it be possible to mint a generic talentDAO research NFT that can be minted indefinitely for ongoing talentDAO research teams to reward participants with?

I’ve been involved in the crypto space for a couple years now, but it’s really only this year that I’ve gone down the web3 rabbit hole with NFTs, DAOs, and everything in between. As an I/O, DAOs are particularly fascinating to me so I’ve gotten myself involved with a number of them including BrightMoments, OpenAccessDAO, and now TalentDAO. It’s great to see a community of I/O psychologists [technologists?] come together in the DAO ecosystem. I truly believe DAOs represent a paradigm shift in the way humans organize themselves around shared objectives and I’m so excited to see what they can unlock for human potential!",,👋introduction,"12/13/2021, 20:24:10"

Okay, so what exactly is Colony again?
Colony is the most powerful, practical, flexible, and easy to use DAO framework.

Powerful
Everything an organization needs to operate on-chain. Payments, Teams, Authority, Governance, Fundraising, Revenue sharing, Arbitration, the ability to interact with any other smart contract on Ethereum, and a whole lot more.

Practical
In a healthy organization, voting should be rare. That's why Colony operates a more agile system of 'lazy consensus'. It means organizations spend their time productively, not endlessly voting.

Flexible
Colony Core provides powerful primitives for finances, org structure, and authority. Extensions are plug-ins that build on those, shaping organizations according to their needs.

Easy
Colony makes DAOs easy. Unlike the complicated, clunky competition, Colony's application seamlessly integrates powerful DAO functionality into a polished, logical, and easy to use experience.

We see Colony as the core of a suite of tools a Decentralized Organization needs to manage its operations. For Colony, as a team, that suite of tools looks something like this: [Colony - Governance & Finance] [Notion - Knowledge & Planning] [Asana - Project Management] [Discord - Chat]

k3nn.eth,"Fantastic read. Thanks for sharing. It sounds like there is a need for profit sharing mechanism to support this new incentive structure. We shouldn’t fight the fact that power laws exist, and if we want to generate the most value, we should optimize the system around them. Unless deliberately avoided however, optimizing for power laws means worse outcomes for those in the bottom 80%. But we still need the bottom 80% for the whole system to work, so the top 20% should share some of the profit such that the more value they produce, the more that goes back to the community as a whole.

It does sound like there would be some interesting synergies here so maybe we can all get together at some point to discuss. The time element is actually exactly what we are focusing on building out. The idea is that community voice changes over time so we chunk data by periods to get slightly different models of community voice each time. My buddy who’s working with me on it is an AI engineer so he’s had some really innovative ideas about how to engineer a system like this. Definitely would love to hear your thoughts when we have something more demo ready. If everything goes well with our standford connection, we may even get our hands on the original dataset for the study 🤞🏼. Ultimately our primary goal is to demonstrate how GPT-3 can supplement if not replace many traditional NLP libraries/tools used in text analysis  and as a secondary goal, build an improved method over Stanford’s empath approach for analyzing communication networks and classifying outcomes from text data [e.g., burnout].",saulthorin,🦺onboarding_study,"12/29/2021, 19:19:18"
